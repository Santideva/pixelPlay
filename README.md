# pixelPlay    

## A dynamic visualization tool in Javascript 

pixePlay dynamically creates evolving, animated patterns of colored pixels on an HTML5 canvas. Pixels are drawn and propagate outwards from a central point,
changing colors and spreading based on specific rules. The program uses cartesian co-ordinates to center the origin in the middle of the canvas, 
draws pixels at specific co-ordinates, generates random RGB values with Math.random(), handles outward propagation of RGB values via custom logic
and animates the changes through the requestAnimationFrame method.
